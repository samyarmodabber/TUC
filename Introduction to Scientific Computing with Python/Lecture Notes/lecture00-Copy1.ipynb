More concretely, Python is a programming language that, in contrast to other programming languages such as C, Fortran, or Java, allows users to more readily focus and solve domain problems instead of dealing with the complexity of how a computer operates. Python achieves this goal by having the following attributes:"

In addition, **a high-level language can be expressed in a manner closer to English prose or mathematical equations.** \n",

This set of mathematical theories and techniques is called **Numerical Analysis** (or Numerical Mathematics) and constitutes a major part of scientific computing. The development of the electronic computer, however, signaled a new era in the approach to the solution of scientific problems. Many of the numerical methods that had been developed for the purpose of hand calculation (including the use of desk calculators for the actual arithmetic) had to be revised and sometimes abandoned. Considerations that where irrelevant or unimportant for hand calculation now became of utmost importance for the efficient and correct use of a large Computer System. Many of these considerations –**programming languages, operating systems, "

But mathematics itself continues to play a major role in scientific computing: it provides the language of the mathematical models that are to be solved and information about the suitability of a model **(Does it have a solution? Is the solution unique?)** and it provides the theoretical foundation for the numerical methos and, increasingly, many of the tools from computer science.\n",
