    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `threading` module uses `threads`, the `multiprocessing` module uses `processes`. The difference is that threads run in the **same memory space**, while processes have **separate memory**. This makes it a bit harder to share objects between processes with multiprocessing. Since threads use the same memory, precautions have to be taken or two threads will write to the same memory at the same time. This is what the global interpreter lock is for."
